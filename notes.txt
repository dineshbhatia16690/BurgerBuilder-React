Setting up the Project:
- Eject css modules (npm run eject)
- Clean up extra files
- Set up font and title for the project

Creating a layout Component:
- Structurized the project and created a simple layout adding toolbar, sidebar and backdrop.
- Since we don't have the navigation yet, so the focus is to develop the core functionality.

Starting implementation of the Burger Builder Container:
- Added a layout.css file which will have the underneath layout.
- Changed webpack.config.js to enable css modules.
