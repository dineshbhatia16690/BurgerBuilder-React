Setting up the Project:
- Eject css modules (npm run eject)
- Clean up extra files
- Set up font and title for the project

Creating a layout Component:
- Structurized the project and created a simple layout adding toolbar, sidebar and backdrop.
- Since we don't have the navigation yet, so the focus is to develop the core functionality.

Starting the Burger component:
- Added the burger component and hardcoded ingredients.

Outputting Burger Ingredient Dynamically:
- Added ingredients to state to dynamically add them.
- Added transformed ingredient variable in Burger.js which essentially transforms the js object of values into array which
  contains values(ingredient) as many times as the quantity.

Calculating the Ingredient sum Dynamically:
- Takes care of showing a message to add ingredients if there is no ingredient or value 0 for each ingredient.
- Does so by using flattening the array so that all inner arrays elements are extracted in one array.

Adding the build control component:
- Adds styling for build control component, the label, buttons, etc.

Outputting the multiple build controls:
- Added build control buttons and shows all the build controls components together.

Connecting state to Build Controls:

- Added disabling the less button functionality in case the ingredient is not added
